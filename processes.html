                                <li>Respect my team-mates, the other team, the referee and my coach/manager.</li>
                                <li>Play by the rules, as directed by the referee.</li>

                            <p>I understand that if I do not follow the code, any or all of the following actions may be taken by my club, County FA or The FA. I may:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Be required to apologise to my team-mates, the other team, referee or team manager.</li>

                            <p>This club is supporting The FA’s Respect programme to ensure football can be enjoyed in a safe, positive environment.</p>
                            <p>Remember children’s football is a time for them to develop their technical, physical, tactical and social skills.</p>

                                <li>Each player and his/her parents/carers must make suitable arrangements to and from training and matches so as to be punctual and not arrive later than 30 minutes prior to each scheduled match.</li>
                                <li>Where the club supplies kit, it is the responsibility of each player to make sure their kit is kept safe and cleaned after every match.</li>
                                <li>Players and parents/carers are reminded that football is a contact sport and potentially dangerous. Shin pads must be worn at and a suitable drink brought to every training session and every match. Care must be taken by
                                    each player to ensure that before and after each training session and match, proper stretching takes place to avoid muscle and other injury. During cold periods, it is advisable to bring warm clothing in addition to
                                    the kit if you are a substitute. </li>
                                <li>Care must be taken to avoid dangerous tackles and the latest FA rules on the subject must be strictly adhered to, e.g. no tackles from behind.</li>
                                <li>All player and parents/carers must read and abide by the club’s code of conduct.</li>
                                <li>Under no circumstances can the club be held responsible for any loss, injury or damage suffered or incurred by the players and their parents/carers whilst on their way to or from training and matches, while on club or away
                                    premises or while playing, save that the club excludes liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence. The club takes the view that it is the responsibility of the players and parents/carers to avoid
                                    any situation likely to give rise to loss or injury, both to their person and their effects. </li>
                                <li>A player must not have any outstanding money, kit, etc. owing to previous clubs.</li>
                                <li>Annual membership fees are to be paid upon registration with either a one-off payment or in three instalments, <span style="font-weight: bolder">paid by the 1st June, 1st August and 1st October.</span> Failure to pay by
                                    the agreed dates or if payments are not honoured will result in the player’s registration card being withheld and eligibility to play being immediately withdrawn until full payment has been received. </li>

                                <li>Players will not be allowed to register if fees for the previous season have not been paid in full.</li>
