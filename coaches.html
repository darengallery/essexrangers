                            <p>Coaching and practise play a big part at Essex Rangers and we believe we have somewhat of a unique outlook.</p>
                            <p>Various phases based predominantly by age group has been installed into the practise and playing philosophy of the club to support player development throughout the club.</p>
                            <p>It is vital we all understand that players and children will perform and develop better in a healthy and positive environment.</p>
                            <p>With this in mind, we will base our philosophy not only to attempt to produce good teams and individuals on the pitch, we will also look to help children discover what sport can do for their own personal childhood journey,
                                through puberty and adolescence.</p>
                            <p>Sport brings so many positives to children’s and adults’ lives and at the club we will attempt to help the children uncover the positives about learning whilst having fun, understand how friendships can help their confidence
                                and support their personal growth.</p>
                            <p>Like everything in life, we have individuals who Struggle a bit, people who can cope and those that find themselves forging ahead.</p>
                            <p>We view sport and football as a subject and like any subject it needs a curriculum and a review process, and one that support the development of players in all three categories.</p>
                            <p>As you all know football is a team sport however, we value the progress of individuals as well as the team success.</p>
                            <p>When providing a curriculum, we will need to cater for both, and we need to consider how we meet all the players needs as well as the team.</p>
                            <p>A full curriculum will be provided to all mangers prior to the start of the season well in advance in order to discuss and adjust any elements.</p>
                            <p>Coaches and managers will play a vital part in the overall development of the club.</p>
                            <p>We must make sure the managers get all of the necessary support and gain the necessary understanding of how to get the most from the individuals within his team.</p>
                            <p>Coaching support from the Saturday practise will be on hand and a clear understanding of how the club support the managers and Coaches in the personal journey is agreed before each season will start.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="card-body" id="main">
                        <h2 class="card-title text-center">How we coach and why?</h2>
                        <p>Coaches and managers will work closer to ensure this takes place on Saturdays and Sundays and the communication to parents will be better in helping them understand what is actually going on and why we do what we do and why we
                            do it in the way we do.</p>
                        <P>A practise structure will be introduced covering three areas of individual practise.</P>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Constant</li>
                            <li>Variable</li>
                            <li>Random</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>We believe this will cover all individual areas and will be explained again to support understanding by parents.</p>
                        <p>We will explain using a tennis coaches’ analogy.</p>
                        <p>Constant- Serving a ball 10 times at the same speed, from the same spot, to the same target.</p>
                        <p>Variable- Serving a ball 10 times, but varying one of the following each time: speed, distance, velocity, target</p>
                        <p>Random - Passing, then hitting then serving, then diving and Practicing non-repeating types of attacks- line, cross, line, sharp-cross, off the block, line… etc</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>Constant -
                                <li>Tennis - Serving a ball 10 times at the same speed, from the same spot, to the same target</li>
                                <li>Football - it could be play 1 pass to player 2 and when he receives the ball, he passes back to player 1. This constant practise supports players that may need individual improvement to their technique in short passing.
                                    This constant practise will help improve this by numerous attempts and self-correcting over a period and by the sheer number of attempts. This could also be simplified by a player kicking the ball against the wall.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>Variable -
                                <li>Tennis - Serving a ball 10 times, but varying one of the following each time: speed, distance, velocity, target</li>
                                <li>Football - Player 2, when receiving from player 1 then turns and passes to target or targets, thus adding different techniques, decision making and execution of pass.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This helps with awareness, decision making, and examination of technique.</p>

                            <ul>Random -
                                <li>Tennis - Passing, then hitting then serving, then diving and Practicing non-repeating types of attacks- line, cross, line, sharp-cross, off the block, line… etc</li>
                                <li>Football Player 2 receives from player 1, turns and enters a 3v2 practise will a realism of what football is like on a Sunday during a game.This helps with speed of decision, choice of execution and the Sunday games. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It also provides a game like speed with realism to it.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p>What I am claiming is practise is the lesson and the games are a test.</p>
                        <p>How do we prepare our children for a test, how do they approach it.?</p>
                        <p>I will suggest with a lot more calmness if they go into it with the answers??</p>
                        <p>As I get constantly reminded, we need to introduce and increase 'team coaching' including restarts. What are restarts?</p>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Goal kicks</li>
                                <li>Free kicks (For/Against)</li>
                                <li>Corners (For/Against)</li>
                                <li>Throw ins</li>
                                <li>Kick off</li>
                                <li>Playing out from the back (Linked to Goal kicks)</li>
                                <li>Team formation across the formats (One should link to the next)</li>
                                <li>Position specific Coaching</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>I would ask the question please always bear in mind should we teach the children the game or just how to win?</p>
                        <p>Again, individuals should be considered in how we meet their specific needs.</p>
                        <p>Please be mindful this may need to be achieved on an individual basis.</p>
